*****DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL GIT*****

sudo apt-get install git

*****CONFIGURE YOUR GIT TO CONNECT WITH ACCOUNT*****

git config --global user.name "lab2272"
git config --global user.email "winkleac@dukes.jmu.edu"

*****CREATE A LOCAL REPO FOR WORK*****

git init HSSim

[HSSim is the name of whatever you want your working repo to be, in our case I decided to call it "HSSim"]

cd HSSim

*****PULL FILES TO LOCAL REPO FROM GITHUB REPO*****

git pull

[once files are pulled from github repo and local repo is synced, add new files to ~/HSSim that you want to push to github repo and proceed to next step]

*****ADDING REPO FILES TO AN INDEX*****

git add [filename]

*****COMMIT CHANGES MADE TO INDEX*****

git commit -m "some comment about files here"

git remote add origin https://github.com/lab2272/HSSim.git

*****PUSHING FILES IN LOCAL REPO TO GITHUB REPO*****

git push origin master

*****NOTE*****
A common error I've encountered is when attempting to use the "git remote add" command the system responds with "fatal: remote origin already exists". the only fix for this error is to type in the terminal:

git remote rm origin

and hit enter. I'll update this tutorial later on if I'm able to find a more permanent solution, because this is the only one I know of currently and it seems that you have to do it every time you attempt to commit something to the github repo.
